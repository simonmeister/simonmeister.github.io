    <h1>Notes on nutrition & prevention</h1>
    
    <div>
      Here are some basic notes on diet & prevention, for minimal ecological impact and maximum longevity and health.
      References are rather incomplete, use Google where needed; too busy atm.
  
      This is a collection of personal research notes; it's not medical advice.

    <h3 id="insights">Basic insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your grains intact (e.g. coarse oats, not flour) as much as possible for optimal blood sugar response, 
      gut microbiome health, appetite management</li>
      <li>Avoid blending fruit for similar reasons. Blueberries & blackberries are an exception.</li>
      <li>Avoid all oil isolates, even olive oil. Together with abstaining from
      animal products, this appears to produce optimal LDL. Studies in primates show that even olive oil promotes atherosclerosis.
      Health benefits shown in general populations are probably because it usually replaces even worse isolated fats. Ornish-type
      diets (<= 15% fat plant-based) are the only interventions I am aware of that have been shown to arrest (and even reverse) plaque-caused CVD.
      Futhermore, it appears that de-novo lipogenesis is more diffcult in ultra-low-fat diets, making weight management easier. 
      A personal data point: my LDL is 52, total cholesterol is 111. My brother's were essentially the same after the switch to low-fat plant-based.
      </li>
      <li>To minimize dAGE (and acrylamide), abstain from: meat, high-fat dairy, 
      processed fats/oils, anything processed with high heat, particularly cooking with oil
        [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/">6</a>]
      </li>
      <li>To prevent TMAO-mediated atherosclerosis, avoid any meat intake as well as carnitine and choline supplements</li>
      <li>No alcohol, not even red wine, to avoid acetaldehyde
        [<a href="ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847467/">7</a>, WHO]
      </li>
      <li>Avoid high-oxalate foods. The worst offenders include spinach, beets, rhubarb. 
      If you have a history of kidney stones and high urinary oxalate, optimize further, see e.g.
      
        [<a href="https://ucikidneystonecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Oxalate-Content-of-Foods.pdf">8</a>].
      In that case, avoid high-dose Vitamin C, and potentially avoid high-dose Vitamin D3.   
      </li>
      <li>Keep protein intake reasonably low. There are likely benefits for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562018/">aging</a>, and kidney health.
      There seem to be quickly diminishing returns for muscle building for anything above 1.5g per kg of bodyweight. Older individuals might want to err on the lower side,
      towards 1g/kg or less.</li>
      <li>Avoid animal protein in general, and dairy protein specifically, due to role as potential cancer growth accelerator</li>
      <li>Avoid eggs due to potential increase of prostate cancer risk</li>
      <li>Avoid fish oil and most fish flesh due to heavy metal exposure</li>
      <li>Hold a daily fast towards ~16 hours or more, ideally starting in the early evening, to optimize weight management and for anti-aging benefits</li>
      <li>Get 30 minutes of daily exercise. If you run, consider minimalist (zero-drop + "barefoot") shoes to avoid injury.</li>
      <li>Ensure high intake of sulforaphane & green tea catechins, ideally from whole food. This appears to have potent anti-cancer effects.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="food">Food selection</h3>
    Note: I took a lot of care to optimize oxalate content, which might be excessive for many. Below are my staples. 
    I occasionally add other whole plant foods for variety, but take care of blood sugar profile.
    I personally try to keep fat intake around 15% of calories, all of it from whole-food sources. 
    Some people may be less concerned about fat intake. In this case, you might add more (raw, unsalted) nuts (which are all relatively high in oxalates).
    <ul>
      <li>Fruits: mostly blackberries and blueberries, for their antioxidant value, micronutrient profile, 
       blood sugar benefits. Also strawberries, cherries, limes, sultanas, and the occasional banana or apple. 
      </li>
      <li>Food sources of essential fatty acids: freshly ground flax seeds (keep in fridge for up to a week), hemp seeds.</li>
      <li>Sources of energy and protein: whole oats, lentils, chickpeas, peas, optionally small amounts of pea protein, 
      small amounts of other whole grains.</li>
      <li>
        Cruciferous vegetables: kale, broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, savoy cabbage, home-grown broccoli sprouts. Important:
        <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-to-cook-broccoli/">blend or finely chop</a> 
        before cooking to get sulforaphane, or better: eat raw (as a salad), and blend an hour before eating.
      </li>
      <li>Other vegetables: bell peppers, onions, small amounts of tomatoes</li>
      <li>Spices: ceylon cinnamon, garlic, fresh herbs, small amounts of other spices. I am careful with turmeric due to oxalate.</li>
      <li>Misc: dark chocolate >= 80% (undutched & from a region where cocoa has minimal heavy-metal exposure, e.g. Dominican Republic or Tanzania), plain unsweetened soy milk for its phytonutrients (note that some soy products can be high oxalate)</li>
      <li>Beverages: green tea (Nepal, for low cadmium & lead exposure), slow-roasted (otherwise acrylamide is a concern) coffee </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="plan">Diet plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Breakfast: Coarse oats with cinnamon, 1/2 Tsp of freshly ground flax seeds, blueberries & chopped banana, a cup of soymilk</li>
      <li>Lunch: Low-sodium lentil or pea soup with side of low-sodium whole-grain bread. Red cabbage salad (with apple cider vinegar, spices, fresh apples & sultanas), prepared every 2-3 days</li>
      <li>Afternoon: Another serving of oatmeal. </li>
      <li>Post-workout: A serving of huel essential (contains oats, pea protein, flax seeds), as a calorie booster, with 70g of fresh black & blue berries blended in. 
       This is the one meal breaking the intact whole-foods rule.</li>
      <li>Dinner: curry with chickpeas and cauliflower or something similar. Raw broccoli salad (with apple cider vinegar, fresh apples), prepared at least ~1 hour before eating, prepared every 2-3 days</li>
      <li>10g of raw freshly grown* broccoli sprouts (sulforaphane content peaks after 2 days), pre-chopped ~1 hour before eating; half with lunch, half with dinner.</li>
      <li>5g of dark chocolate</li>
      <li>5g of peanuts</li>
      <li>1 cup of coffee, 1-3 cups of green tea</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>(*) Growing broccoli sprouts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Soak seeds in HOCl for 15 minutes to disinfect</li>
        <li>Put into sprouting glass with mesh lid, rinse ~5 times, then soak in cool water overnight/12h+, drain</li>
        <li>Rinse twice daily, store upside down to fully drain</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 id="supplements">Supplements</h3>
    I am relatively conservative when it comes to supplements.
    E.g. I supplement creatine and taurine to achieve average omnivore levels of dietary intake, but not more.
    Cronometer can additionally help to see where you might have deficits in theory. 
    Regular blood tests, particularly for B12 and homocysteine, are smart.
    
    <ul>
      <li>Algae-oil: 400-800mg DHA, 200-400mg EPA daily. (as plain oil to avoid carrageenan from softgels, but make sure to keep in fridge)</li>
      <li>Vitamin K2-MK7: 200mcg</li>
      <li>Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin): 1000mcg (or 50mcg of the more stable cyanocobalamin)</li>
      <li>Zinc bisglycinate: 15mg (to counteract cadmium from modern fertilizers, and due to reduced absorption from high phytate intake)</li>
      <li>Bromelain: 400mg</li>
      <li>Pre-formed Vitamin A (retinylpalmitate): 1g</li>
      <li>Quercetin: 250mg</li>
      <li>Creatine: 1-1.5g (for performance; might be needed to 
        <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-efficacy-and-safety-of-creatine-for-high-homocysteine/">
          normalize homocysteine
        </a>
        in some vegans)</li>
      <li>Iodine: 150mcg (from organic kelp)</li>
      <li>Others: selenium, if dietary intake is low (analyse e.g. using Cronometer)</li>
      <li>Calcium (citrate): 250mg (to top up my intake from cruciferous vegetables, bind oxalate)</li>
      <li>Taurine: 50mg</li>
      <li>Beta-alanine (to form carnosine): 0.5-1g (optional, might reduce endogenous AGEs along with taurine)
      
        [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16804013/">8</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876491/">9</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15607576/">10</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858687/">11</a>]
      </li>
      <li> 
        Normally, I'd take 2000IU of Vitamin D3 daily. For people with a history of kidney stones, it's unclear if it is worth the 
        potential increase in kidney stone risk. The science on this association isn't entirely clear yet.
      </li>
    </ul>

    
    
    <h3 id="covid">COVID protocol</h4>
    
    Upon potential exposure to COVID or before high-risk activities (e.g. crowded events): 
    <ul>
      <li>Vitamin C, up to 1g daily</li>
      <li>Increase zinc intake to 100mg/day</li>
      <li>Vitamin D3 5000IU daily</li>
      <li>Bromelain & quercetin as above (if not already regularly supplemented)</li>
      <li>Use algae-based virucidal nasal spray (forming a mechanical barrier) and virucidal gargling, 3x daily, or just before/after potential exposure</li>
      <li>Use FFP3 mask in high-risk situations</li>
    </ul>
