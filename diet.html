    <h1>A reasonably optimized diet</h1>
    
    This is my diet optimized for minimal ecological impact and maximum longevity and health. It turns out to be fully vegan.
    Add any supplements you consider helpful according to established or emerging research - but remember: first, do no harm.
    References are rather incomplete, use Google where needed; too busy atm.

    <h3>Basic insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your grains intact (e.g. coarse oats, not flour) as much as possible for optimal blood sugar response, 
      gut microbiome health, appetite management</li>
      <li>Avoid blending fruit for similar reasons. Blueberries & blackberries are an exception.</li>
      <li>Avoid all oil isolates, even olive oil. Studies in primates show that even olive oil promotes atherosclerosis.
      Health benefits shown in general populations are probably because it usually replaces even worse isolated fats. Ornish-type
      diets (<= 15% fat plant-based) are the only interventions I am aware of that have been shown to arrest (and even reverse) plaque-caused CVD.
      Futhermore, it appears that de-novo lipogenesis is more diffcult in ultra-low-fat diets, making weight management easier.
      </li>
      <li>To minimize dAGE (and acrylamide), abstain from: meat, high-fat dairy, 
      processed fats/oils, high-heat cooking
        [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/">6</a>]
      </li>
      <li>To prevent TMAO-mediated atherosclerosis, avoid any meat intake as well as carnitine and choline supplements</li>
      <li>No alcohol, not even red wine - avoid acetaldehyde
        [<a href="ttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19847467/">7</a>, WHO]
      </li>
      <li>Avoid high-oxalate foods. The worst offenders: spinach, beets, rhubarb. 
      If you have a history of kidney stones and high urinary oxalate, optimize further, see e.g.
      
        [<a href="https://ucikidneystonecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Oxalate-Content-of-Foods.pdf">8</a>].
      In that case, avoid high-dose Vitamin C, and potentially avoid high-dose Vitamin D3.   
      </li>
      <li>Keep protein intake reasonably low. There are likely benefits for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562018/">aging</a>, and kidney health.
      There seem to be quickly diminishing returns for muscle building for anything above 1.5g per kg of bodyweight. Older individuals might want to err on the lower side,
      towards 1g/kg or less.</li>
      <li>Avoid animal protein in general, and dairy protein specifically, due to role as potential cancer growth accelerator</li>
      <li>Avoid eggs due to potential increase of prostate cancer risk</li>
      <li>Avoid fish oil and most fish flesh due to heavy metal exposure</li>
      <li>Hold a daily fast towards ~16 hours or more, ideally starting in the early evening, to optimize weight management and for anti-aging benefits</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>My food selection</h3>
    Note: I took a lot of care to optimize oxalate content, which might be excessive for many. Below are my staples. 
    I occasionally add other whole plant foods for variety, but take care of blood sugar profile.
    I personally try to keep fat intake around 15% of calories, all of it from whole-food sources. 
    Some people may be less concerned about fat intake. In this case, you might add (raw, unsalted) nuts (which are all moderately high in oxalates).
    <ul>
      <li>Fruits: mostly blackberries and blueberries, for their antioxidant value, micronutrient profile, 
       blood sugar benefits. Also strawberries, cherries, limes, sultanas, and the occasional banana. 
      </li>
      <li>Food sources of essential fatty acids: freshly ground flax seeds, hemp seeds.</li>
      <li>Sources of energy and protein: whole oats, lentils, chickpeas, small amounts of pea protein, 
      small amounts of other whole grains.</li>
      <li>
        Cruciferous vegetables: kale, broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage. Important:
        <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-to-cook-broccoli/">blend or finely chop</a> 
        before cooking to get sulforaphane. Red cabbage is great to eat raw.
      </li>
      <li>Other vegetables: bell peppers, small amounts of tomatoes</li>
      <li>Spices: ceylon cinnamon, small amounts of other spices. I am careful with turmeric due to oxalate.</li>
      <li>Misc: dark chocolate >= 80%, plain unsweetened soy milk for its phytonutrients (note that some soy products can be high oxalate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Supplements</h4>
    I am relatively conservative when it comes to supplements. I recommend using cronometer to see where you might have deficits, and do regular blood tests,
    particularly for B12 and homocysteine.
    E.g. I supplement creatine and taurine to achieve average carnivore levels, but not more.
    <ul>
      <li>Algae-oil: 400-800mg DHA, 200-400mg EPA daily. (as plain oil to avoid carrageenan from softgels)</li>
      <li>Vitamin K2-MK7: 200mcg</li>
      <li>Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin): 1000mcg</li>
      <li>Zinc bisglycinate: 15mg (to counteract cadmium from modern fertilizers, and due to reduced absorption from high phytate intake)</li>
      <li>Bromelain: 400mg</li>
      <li>Pre-formed Vitamin A (retinylpalmitate): 1g</li>
      <li>Quercetin: 250mg</li>
      <li>Creatine: 1-1.5g (for performance; might be needed to 
        <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-efficacy-and-safety-of-creatine-for-high-homocysteine/">
          normalize homocysteine
        </a>
        in some vegans)</li>
      <li>Iodine: 150mg (from organic kelp)</li>
      <li>Calcium (citrate): 200mg (to top up my intake from cruciferous vegetables, bind oxalate)</li>
      <li>Taurine: 50mg</li>
      <li>Beta-alanine (to form carnosine): 0.5-1g (optional, might reduce endogenous AGEs along with taurine)
      
        [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16804013/">8</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11876491/">9</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15607576/">10</a>,
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858687/">11</a>]
      </li>
      <li> 
        Normally, I'd take 2000IU of Vitamin D3 daily. For people with a history of kidney stones, it's unclear if it is worth the 
        potential increase in kidney stone risk.
